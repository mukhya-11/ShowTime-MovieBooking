# Movie Seat Booking Website

This project is a Movie Seat Booking Website, designed to facilitate the booking of movie tickets through a web interface. Users can select movies, choose showtimes, and pick their seats from an interactive layout.

## Features
- Form validation for user details
- Select a movie and showtime
- Choose seats from an interactive layout
- Local storage to save previously booked seats based on the movie, date, and time

## How to Use
1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Select a movie from the available options.
3. Fill in your details, choose a date and showtime and submit the form.
4. Pick & confirm your seats from the interactive seat map.
5. To reset the booking data, clear your browser's local storage or history.

## Notes
- The website uses local storage to save previously booked seats based on the movie, date, and time, simulating real-time seat updates.
- To store user entries, you can create a table by copying the code in `database.sql`. The website's local storage functionality will still work without it.
